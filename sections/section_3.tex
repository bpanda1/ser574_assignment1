Section 3 focus on the primary steps involved in software design and architecture.


Software Design is both a process and model. One of the main component of software design is the software requirment analysis. Depending on the software, software design can be as simple as a flow chart or defined in a models like Unified Modeling Language (UML). 

Davis [cited] suggests a set of principles for software design which have been adapted and extended.

Tunnel Vision: 
Tracebility:
Resouce reusability:
Modularity: minimizing the intellectual distance
Uniformity and Integration: Fully coherent, less coupling
Open to change: As change is inevitable, a model which is adopts changes is good.

May be I can explain Design concepts and patterns: like Abstraction. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design]
