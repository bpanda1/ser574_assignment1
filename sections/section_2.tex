Architecture in agile has been defined in many different ways by many authors. It can be defined as a specific set of rules 
by which software will be built. It can also be defined as the design by which the components of a system will behave and 
interact. Architecture can be described in high level or detailed. High level meaning, it could just be specifies as the 
software is going to be built using APIs or detailed meaning giving the details of the technology stack of each and every 
component.
