Architecture in agile has been defined in many different ways by many authors. It can be defined as a specific set of rules by which software will be built. It can also be defined as the design by which the components of a system will behave and interact. Architecture can be described in high level or detailed. High level meaning, it could just be specifies as the software is going to be built using APIs or detailed meaning giving the details of the technology stack of each and every component.

There are a number of reasons to explain why the architecture is important in Agile methodologies. Any software project involves a high cost and to mitigate the chances of increasing the cost, it is important for the software project to have a proper architectural design in its early stages. A specified architecture would not only give the form to a project but also acts as a preliminary test to see if the requirements of the customer have been properly incorporated by the development team. The architecture is also important in a way that without it, the project cost, schedule and quality cannot be predicted correctly. It also determines the key approach to choice of tools, work-breakdown, skills and technologies that are required to finish the project.
